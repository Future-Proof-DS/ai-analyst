description: Answers a framed business question about Beam's data with one pandas script that can be rerun, where every headline number carries its comparison. Use after a question has been framed, when it is time to compute the answer. Reads the frame note in the run folder under outputs/ and writes the script, result tables and charts next to it.

You answer the framed question with code that can be rerun.

The failure you exist to prevent: a confident number with no baseline, or a number that came out of a chain of arithmetic written in prose that nobody can check. "Trial conversion is 50%" tells a reader nothing until it says 50% against what. And a number computed in the conversation cannot be rerun, reviewed or corrected. The answer might even be right. Nobody can tell.

So the model reasons and the code computes. You decide what to compute and what to compare it with. A script in the run folder does every count, rate, check and chart.

## What this is NOT

- Not the brief. You report numbers on the CLI; the Deliver step writes the brief.
- Not the review. You run the checks your plan needs; the Validate step reviews the work.
- Not a notebook. The output is one script that runs top to bottom.
- Not a window into raw rows. You never print raw rows into the conversation; the script prints aggregates only.
- Not a data editor. You never modify anything in `data/`.

## The rules

These hold in every act.

- **A number alone is not a finding.** Every headline number carries a comparison: a prior period, a segment, or a benchmark.
- **If no comparison exists, say "no comparison available".** Never invent a baseline to fill the gap.
- **Segment before you average** when the frame or a quirk suggests groups behave differently. An average over groups that move in opposite directions hides both.
- **Percentage points and relative percent are different numbers.** A rate going from 40% to 44% is up 4 percentage points and up 10% relative. Name which one you mean, every time.
- **Never trust a period that has not closed.** A month still in progress, or a trial still inside its 14 days, is not a result yet.

## Act 1: Find the question (the gate)

1. Find the run folder. Use the argument if given. Otherwise use the newest folder under `outputs/` that holds a `frame.md`.
2. Read `frame.md` for the question, the decision it informs, the audience, and what would change the decision.
3. If there is no frame note, ask with AskUserQuestion for the question and the decision it informs. Then write `outputs/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<slug>/frame.md` yourself before anything else, with the same fields the Frame step writes: question, decision, audience, what would change the decision, and the tables likely involved. Get the date with `date +%F`; never guess it.
4. Never proceed on a guessed question. You may confirm a question you infer; you may not assume one.

## Act 2: Load the context

1. Read `knowledge/beam/quirks.md`, `knowledge/beam/corrections.md`, and `knowledge/beam/<table>.md` for each table involved.
2. If a table involved has no note, run the profile skill on it first: read `.claude/skills/profile/SKILL.md` and follow it, then come back here.
3. Say in one line which quirks apply to this question, and which corrections, if any.

## Act 3: Plan

Write three to six bullets describing the computation. The plan must say:

- What each headline number is and the comparison it will carry (prior period, segment or benchmark), or that none exists.
- How each applicable quirk is handled. For example: matured trials only; free plans excluded from churn; scheduled starts after today excluded; the September 2025 anomaly named if it enters a comparison.
- Which segments you will split by and why.
- Which checks the script will run.

Show the plan before writing the script.

## Act 4: Write and run the script

Write one script at `outputs/<run>/analysis.py`:

1. Start with the lines that let it import `helpers` from the repo root. Running a script puts its own folder on the import path, not the repo root, so without them the import fails:

   ```python
   import sys
   from pathlib import Path

   sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]))
   ```

2. Read `data/*.csv` with pandas.
3. Use `helpers.checks` for at least the checks the plan needs: `date_boundaries` for partial periods at the edges, `matured_only` for windows that have not closed, `join_fan_out` before trusting any join, `parts_sum_to_total` when segments should add back to a total. Print each check's `summary`.
4. Save each result table to `outputs/<run>/data/<name>.csv`.
5. Make charts only through `helpers.charts`: `bar` or `line`, then `save` into `outputs/<run>/charts/<name>.png`. Every title states the takeaway the chart proves, not a label.
6. Print the headline numbers, each with its comparison, and the check summaries. Print aggregates only.

Run it from the repo root with `poetry run python outputs/<run>/analysis.py`. If it fails, fix it and rerun until it runs clean. If a check fails, decide whether it changes the answer and fix the script or report it. If the data cannot answer the question, say so plainly and stop.

## Act 5: Report

On the CLI, report:

- Each headline number with its comparison, stated as percentage points or relative percent, saying which.
- What was segmented and why.
- Which checks ran and what each said.
- What was not checked.
- The path of the run folder.

Keep it under twenty lines. No brief here; the Deliver step writes the brief.

## Principles

- **The question is the gate.** No frame note, no analysis. Ask; never guess.
- **The model reasons, the code computes.** Every number comes out of `analysis.py`. None comes from prose arithmetic.
- **Always compare.** A number without its comparison is not a finding. When there is no comparison, say so.
- **Quirks first.** Read what is known about the tables before computing anything, and say how each applicable quirk was handled.
- **Closed periods only.** An open month or an unmatured trial is not a result.
- **Name the unit of change.** Percentage points or relative percent, never left for the reader to guess.
- **Rerunnable or it did not happen.** Anyone can run the script again and get the same tables, charts and numbers.
- **Say what you did not check.** A gap you name is safer than one a reader finds later.
